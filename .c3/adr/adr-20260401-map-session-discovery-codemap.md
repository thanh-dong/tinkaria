title: Map Session Discovery Codemap
type: adr
goal: Map `src/server/session-discovery.ts` to an owning C3 component so session discovery, resume, and transcript import flow can be traced through C3 without falling back to rule-only lookup results.

## Goal

Map `src/server/session-discovery.ts` to an owning C3 component so session discovery, resume, and transcript import flow can be traced through C3 without falling back to rule-only lookup results.

## Work Breakdown

- Add a dedicated server component for session discovery and transcript import.
- Attach `src/server/session-discovery.ts` to that component through the codemap.
- Update adjacent component docs to show that NATS transport depends on the session-discovery layer for `sessions` snapshots and resume/import support.
## Risks

- Folding this file into `c3-213 discovery` would blur project discovery with session discovery/import responsibilities.
- Leaving it unmapped preserves 100% coverage numerically but weakens architectural traceability for session-management work.
