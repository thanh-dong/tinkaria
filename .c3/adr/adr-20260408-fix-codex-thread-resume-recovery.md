## Goal

Fix codex thread resume failures that cause threads to appear "deleted" with errors like "thread is not rollable".

## Problem

`isRecoverableResumeError()` in `codex-app-server.ts` uses a narrow allowlist of error snippets to decide whether a `thread/resume` failure should fall back to `thread/start`. When the Codex app-server returns an unrecognized error (e.g. "not rollable"), the session is killed and the error is thrown — leaving the chat in a broken state with no result/error entry recorded.

Additionally, `startTurnForChat` in `agent.ts` has no error handling for `startSession`/`startTurn` failures — the user's prompt is appended and `recordTurnStarted` is called, but no error result is recorded, leaving the chat stuck.

## Changes

1. **`src/server/codex-app-server.ts`**: Simplify `isRecoverableResumeError` — ANY `thread/resume` error is recoverable (fall back to `thread/start`). Auth/quota errors don't contain "thread/resume" in the message.

2. **`src/server/agent.ts`**: Wrap `codexRuntime.startSession()` + `startTurn()` in try/catch within `startTurnForChat`. On failure, record a turn error result and call `recordTurnFailed` so the chat doesn't get stuck.
