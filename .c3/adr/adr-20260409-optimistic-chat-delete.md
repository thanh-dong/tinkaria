## Goal

Make chat deletion from sidebar feel instant by applying an optimistic UI pattern: remove the chat from sidebar state immediately after user confirmation, navigate away if needed, then fire the server `chat.delete` command in the background without blocking the UI.

## Affected

- c3-113 (sidebar) — ChatRow delete trigger
- useChatCommands.ts — `handleDeleteChat` function
- useAppState.ts — expose `setSidebarData` to commands layer
## Approach

1. Pass `setSidebarData` into `ChatCommandsArgs`
2. In `handleDeleteChat`, after dialog confirmation:
- Optimistically filter the chat from `sidebarData.projectGroups` and call `setSidebarData`
- Clear cached chat + navigate immediately (synchronous)
- Fire `socket.command({ type: "chat.delete" })` without awaiting — errors logged to console.warn
1. The server will eventually push a fresh sidebar snapshot via WS, which re-syncs state
## Decision

Optimistic removal. The server-side delete (`agent.disposeChat` + `store.deleteChat`) involves process teardown and file IO that should never block the UI.
