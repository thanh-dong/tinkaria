## Goal

Transform ProjectPage from extensions-only to a session management hub with two tabs: Sessions (default) and Extensions.

## Context

The /project/:groupKey page currently only shows detected extensions. It should be the primary session management surface showing all project chats with status, actions (fork, merge, rename, archive, delete), and an archived section.

## Decision

- Add top-level SegmentedControl with Sessions | Extensions tabs, Sessions as default
- Client-only archive via zustand persist store (no server changes)
- Reuse CoordinationPanel primitives for session list layout
- Session data from existing sidebarData.workspaceGroups
## Affected Components

- c3-117 (projects) — gains session management panel, top-level tab control
- c3-120 (extensions) — unchanged, moves into Extensions tab branch
## Changes

- NEW: src/client/stores/archivedSessionsStore.ts
- NEW: src/client/components/project/ProjectSessionsPanel.tsx
- MODIFY: src/client/app/ProjectPage.tsx
