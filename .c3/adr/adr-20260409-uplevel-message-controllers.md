## Goal

Eliminate the "box in box" controller pattern in RichContentBlock by hoisting all situational controls (embed render/source toggle, zoom, copy) from inner content wrappers to the outermost block header as icon buttons. On mobile, the entire control bar relocates to the bottom edge for thumb reachability.

## Decision

- **Unified header controls**: RichContentBlock renders all controls (type-specific + universal) as icon buttons in a single header bar (desktop) or bottom bar (mobile)
- **Embed controls hoisted**: Render/Source toggle (Eye/Code icons) and zoom controls moved from InlineEmbedControls (inside content body) to RichContentBlock header
- **Context provider**: RichContentBlock provides ContentViewerContext so embed children read state from the block, not manage local state
- **MetaCodeBlock simplified**: Copy button moved from absolute-positioned inside scrollable pre to a label row above the code block
- **Mobile bottom bar**: All action buttons (copy, expand, fullscreen, type-specific) render in a sticky bottom bar on mobile, title stays at top
## Affects

- c3-107 (rich-content): RichContentBlock now owns viewer state and renders controls; EmbedRenderer becomes pure content
- c3-111 (messages): MetaCodeBlock copy button hoisted to label row
- c3-106 (present-content): No code changes — consumes RichContentBlock which now handles controls internally
## Status

accepted
