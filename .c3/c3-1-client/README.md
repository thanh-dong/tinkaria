- Provide embedded terminal workspace via xterm.js
- Manage UI state (theme, layout, preferences) via Zustand stores
- Connect to server via WebSocket for real-time state updates
- Handle project navigation, sidebar, and settings UI
## Complexity Assessment

Moderate-to-Complex: 96 TSX/TS files, rich message rendering pipeline, multi-panel layout with resizable panes, terminal integration, drag-and-drop project ordering.
