## Responsibilities

- Persist all state via JSONL event logs with snapshot compaction
- Route WebSocket messages and manage topic-based subscriptions
- Coordinate multi-turn AI sessions (Claude SDK + Codex CLI)
- Spawn and manage PTY terminals
- Scan local filesystem for Claude/Codex projects
- Serve static SPA assets in production
## Complexity Assessment

Complex: Event sourcing with replay, multi-provider agent orchestration, subprocess management (CLI + PTY), CQRS read model derivation, real-time WebSocket broadcasting.
